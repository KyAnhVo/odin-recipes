    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="description">Being able to confidently say, “I can make an omelet” is the culinary equivalent of having
        the perfect little black dress in your closet. With your newly acquired omelet skills, you’ll have a chic,
        elegant option for any occasion. Having brunch with the roomies? Make omelets. Home late and feeling hungry?
        Start cracking those eggs. Out of anything immediately edible and considering an emergency call for pizza?
        Make an omelet instead.</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and bell pepper in butter until just tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables to a bowl, season with 1/4 teaspoon salt, and set aside.</li>

            <li>Beat together eggs, milk, remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a separate bowl.</li>

            <li>Melt remaining 1 tablespoon butter in the skillet over medium heat; swirl to coat the bottom of the skillet with butter. When butter is bubbly, pour in egg mixture and cook undisturbed until the bottom of eggs begin to set, about 1 minute. Gently lift the edges of omelet with a spatula to let any uncooked egg flow onto the skillet. Continue cooking until the center of omelet starts to look dry, 1 to 2 more minutes.</li>

            <li>Sprinkle cheese over omelet, then spoon vegetable mixture over 1/2 of the omelet. Use a spatula to gently fold omelet over vegetables. Cook until cheese melts to desired consistency, about 1 minute. Slide omelet onto a plate. Cut in half and serve.</li>
