    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Being able to confidently say, “I can make an omelet” is the culinary equivalent of having
        the perfect little black dress in your closet. With your newly acquired omelet skills, you’ll have a chic,
        elegant option for any occasion. Having brunch with the roomies? Make omelets. Home late and feeling hungry?
        Start cracking those eggs. Out of anything immediately edible and considering an emergency call for pizza?
        Make an omelet instead.</p>
